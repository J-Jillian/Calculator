# ðŸ§® calculator
JavaScript, HTML &amp; CSS calculator project

This calculator works by allowing the user to enter numbers and operators through the buttons provided. The input is displayed on the screen using an HTML input field.

The show(n) function is called when a number or operator button is clicked. This function adds the value of the button to the display value using the += operator.

The wipe() function is called when the AC or C button is clicked. This function clears the display value by setting it to an empty string.

The calc() function is called when the equal button is clicked. This function evaluates the expression entered on the display using the eval() method in JavaScript, 
which calculates the result of the expression. The result is then displayed on the screen.
